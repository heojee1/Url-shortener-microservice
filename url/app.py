# Description:
#   Implements a simple URL-shortening RESTful service.
#   Build with the Flask (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)
#   framework.
#
#   In this service, we try to assign a short identifier to each new URL. This
#   is implemented by choosing a number, and then 'decoding' that in much the
#   same way one would decode a number to a binary string, except with a
#   different base. See 'generate_id()' for this implementation.
#
#   The version in this repository has been extended to support JWTs to
#   identify a user. You can compare it to the reference implementation from
#   assignment 1 to see what has changed (most modern editors should allow you
#   to do this easily).
